    <h2>Page 1 Changes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Added the DOCTYPE to the top of the page.</li>
        <li>Added html tags to the page and updated the set language to English by adding lang="en" to the html tag.</li>
        <li>Updated the meta data to match the rest of the pages.</li>
        <li>Updated the nav bar to include a link to page 5.</li>
        <li>An italics tab was not properly closed in the 7th paragraph, so I fixed the closing tag</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Page 2 Changes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Updated the nav bar to include a link to page 5.</li>
        <li>A bold tag was not properly closed in the New Bradford Inn section, so I fixed the closing tab.</li>
        <li>There were bold tags around the interior header, so I removed them.</li>
        <li>There was a link called "brokenlink.com" in the Description section, so I replaced it with the proper link to a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_(architecture)#:~:text=In%20architecture%2C%20a%20bay%20is,meaning%20an%20opening%20or%20hole.">bay</a>.</li>
        <li>The interior section needed a working link to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_arch">segmental arch</a>, so I added the wikipedia link.</li>
    </ul>
