            <p>The jaguar is the third largest cat species in the world and the largest in the Americas. Its distinct coat is made up of black and tan spots, similar to that of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheetah">cheetah</a>.
            The jaguar has a powerful bite that allows it to break through the shells of different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle">turtle</a> species, as well as the skull of some mammals.</p>
            
            <p>The jaguar's habitat spans all the way from the Southwestern regions of the United States, through many parts of Central America, and down to Northern Argentia.
            They inhabit both forrested and open terrain, but their favorite habitats are tropical and subtropical forrests,
            wetlands, and wooded areas. They are proficient swimmers and opportunistic hunters, so they are most commonly stalking their prey.
            Jaguars have become a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystone_species">keystone species</a>, playing an important role in balancing their ecosystem and limiting the population of animals lower in the food chain.</p>
            
            <h2>Etymology</h2>
            <p>"Jaguar" might have originated from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupi%E2%80%93Guarani_languages">Tupiâ€“Guarani</a> word <em>yaguara</em>, which means 'wild beast that overcomes its prey at a bound'</p>
            
            <h2>Behavior and Ecology</h2>
            <p>Jaguars are mostly active at night, except for those in dense regions of the Amazon Rainforest who hunt primarily during the day.
            Overall, their activity patterns align with the activity of their prey.</p>
