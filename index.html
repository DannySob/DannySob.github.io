                                Originally from Baltimore, Maryland, I am studying Entrepreneurship and Strategy with a minor in Creative Technology and Design at the University of Colorado in Boulder. 
                                I blend my start-up passion with a creative mindset to design products and interfaces that solve people's everyday problems in simple ways.
                                My experience is mainly with Adobe XD, Adobe Photoshop, Figma, and Procreate to develop prototypes, along with experience as a GIS engineer for Think Big Networks.

                            I am currently working on a venture named Proximity, developing a product to help asthmatics find their inhalers in times of need.
